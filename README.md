# 3_Car-Price-Prediction
The price of a car is influenced by numerous factors, including the selling price, present price, driven kms more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning.

In my project, I utilized libraries such as pandas (for reading dataset files), numpy (for array manipulation), matplotlib and seaborn (for plotting), and sklearn (for various machine learning models). To predict car prices, I used the decision tree regression algorithm. The dataset was split into training and test sets to train the model.

I have also included the dataset I used, which was downloaded from Kaggle.
